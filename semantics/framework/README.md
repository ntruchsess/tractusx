The Digital Twin & Semantic Layer is a logical and architectural component of Catena-X.
The source code under this folder contains a library for building your own semantic-enabled Catena-X components. 

### Build Packages:

Run `mvn install` to run unit tests, build and install the package (and submodules)

### Architecture

The SLDT framework provides the following abstractions:
- Configuration objects for 
  - IDS Catalogs, Contracts, Offers, Representations and Artifacts
  - Backend Commands for
    - Accessing Files
    - Querying SQL Databases
- Backend Adapters (Protocols)
  - FILE Access
  - SQL Connections (as XML-Source)
- Transformations
  - From XML-Sources via XSLT Stylesheets
- API Adapters
  - REST Download
  - Digital Twin Registry Publication
- IDS Connector Bus/Plane
  - Fraunhofer Data-Space Connector (DSC) as a remote service
  - Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) as an embedded service

SLDT framework is based on Spring.
Applications using SLDT will most likely apply Spring Boot.

### Submodules

Under [apigen](apigen) we have placed the relevant tools and command lines to regenerate the
IDS connector client stubs which have been placed under the ordinary src folder.
